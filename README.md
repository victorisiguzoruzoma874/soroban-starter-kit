# Soroban Contract Templates

A curated collection of production-ready Soroban smart contract templates. These templates help developers quickly bootstrap common use cases on Soroban (Stellar's smart contract platform) for DeFi, payments, governance, and more.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/soroban-contract-templates.git
cd soroban-contract-templates

# Build a contract from the repo root (example: token)
stellar contract build --manifest-path contracts/token/Cargo.toml
# Alternatively: cd contracts/token && stellar contract build

# Deploy to testnet
./scripts/deploy.sh testnet

# Run tests
cargo test
```

## 📦 Contract Templates

| Template | Description | Use Cases | Status |
|----------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **Token** | Custom fungible token with mint/burn/admin controls | DeFi tokens, governance tokens, utility tokens | ✅ Complete |
| **Escrow** | Two-party escrow with timeout and refund mechanism | P2P trading, service payments, milestone payments | ✅ Complete |

### Token Contract Features
- **Standard Interface**: Full Soroban token compatibility
- **Administrative Controls**: Mint, burn, and admin management
- **Metadata Support**: Name, symbol, and decimals
- **Allowance System**: Approve and transfer_from functionality
- **Event Emission**: All operations emit events for tracking
- **Error Handling**: Custom error types for better debugging

### Escrow Contract Features
- **Two-Party Security**: Secure buyer-seller transactions
- **Deadline Protection**: Automatic refunds after deadline
- **Arbiter Support**: Third-party dispute resolution
- **State Management**: Clear transaction lifecycle
- **Token Agnostic**: Works with any Soroban token
- **Event Emission**: All operations emit events for tracking

Each template includes:
- ✅ Complete contract implementation
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests (8+ test cases each)
- ✅ Deployment scripts with examples
- ✅ Usage examples and documentation

## 🛠 Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (latest stable)
- [Soroban CLI](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/getting-started/setup#install-the-soroban-cli)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for local Stellar node)

## 📖 Usage

### Building Contracts

```bash
cd contracts/[template-name]
stellar contract build
```

### Running Tests

```bash
cd contracts/[template-name]
cargo test
```

### Deploying to Testnet

```bash
cd contracts/[template-name]
./scripts/deploy.sh testnet
```

### Local Development

Start a local Stellar node with Soroban RPC:

```bash
docker compose up stellar-node
```

## ⚠️ Error Reference

> For full details — causes, triggers, and resolution steps — see [docs/error-reference.md](docs/error-reference.md).

### Token Contract Errors (`TokenError`)

| Code | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 1 | `InsufficientBalance` | Caller's balance is too low to complete the transfer or burn |
| 2 | `InsufficientAllowance` | Approved allowance is too low for the requested `transfer_from` amount |
| 3 | `Unauthorized` | Caller is not the admin or does not have permission for this operation |
| 4 | `AlreadyInitialized` | `initialize` was called on a contract that has already been set up |
| 5 | `NotInitialized` | An operation was attempted before the contract was initialized |
| 6 | `InvalidAmount` | Amount is zero, negative, or exceeds the configured max supply |
| 7 | `Overflow` | Arithmetic overflow occurred during a balance or supply calculation |

### Escrow Contract Errors (`EscrowError`)

| Code | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 1 | `NotAuthorized` | Caller is not permitted to invoke this function (wrong party or arbiter) |
| 2 | `InvalidState` | The escrow is not in the required state for this operation |
| 3 | `DeadlinePassed` | The escrow deadline has already elapsed; the operation is no longer valid |
| 4 | `DeadlineNotReached` | The deadline has not yet passed; premature refund or timeout claim attempted |
| 5 | `AlreadyInitialized` | `initialize` was called on an escrow that is already set up |
| 6 | `NotInitialized` | An operation was attempted before the escrow was initialized |
| 7 | `InsufficientFunds` | The buyer's token balance is too low to cover the escrowed amount |
| 8 | `InvalidAmount` | The specified amount is zero or otherwise invalid |
| 9 | `InvalidParties` | Buyer, seller, or arbiter addresses are invalid or conflict with each other |

## 📂 Examples

End-to-end working examples are provided in the `examples/` directory:

| Example | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [`examples/typescript/index.js`](examples/typescript/index.js) | Node.js script — deploys token, mints to buyer, runs full escrow lifecycle |
| [`examples/shell/run.sh`](examples/shell/run.sh) | Equivalent shell script using the Stellar CLI |

Both examples target a local Stellar node. Start one with `./scripts/local-net.sh start` before running.

### TypeScript

```bash
npm install @stellar/stellar-sdk
TOKEN_CONTRACT_ID=<id> ESCROW_CONTRACT_ID=<id> node examples/typescript/index.js
```

### Shell

```bash
./examples/shell/run.sh
```
