# Contract Upgrade Guide

Step-by-step guide for upgrading a contract WASM on-chain using timelock proposals and safe key rotation.

## Overview

On-chain upgrades follow a timelock-protected flow:
1. **Propose** — Admin creates upgrade proposal with new WASM hash
2. **Wait** — Timelock delay passes (governance approval period)
3. **Execute** — Deploy new WASM, verify, and resume operations
4. **Verify** — Confirm new code is live

This ensures security by preventing instant unauthorized upgrades.

## Prerequisites

- Stellar CLI installed and configured
- Admin key (controlled privately)
- New key for signing (for key rotation)
- Testnet or Mainnet RPC endpoint
- Current contract ID

## Step 1: Build New WASM

Build the upgraded contract:

```bash
cd contracts/escrow
stellar contract build

# Output: target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_escrow_contract.wasm
```

Get the WASM hash:

```bash
stellar contract install \
  --network testnet \
  --source admin-key \
  target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_escrow_contract.wasm

# Returns: WASM hash (xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)
# Save this for the proposal step
WASM_HASH="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

## Step 2: Propose Upgrade (with Timelock)

**Important:** Only call this if your contract includes timelock pause functionality (escrow with `pausable` feature).

Propose the upgrade to activate after timelock delay:

```bash
CONTRACT_ID="CXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
ADMIN_KEY="admin-key"
TIMELOCK_DELAY_LEDGERS=300  # ~1.5 hours on mainnet (every 5 seconds)

stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --network testnet \
  --source $ADMIN_KEY \
  -- propose_upgrade --wasm_hash $WASM_HASH
```

**Response:** Proposal created. Current ledger: `12345`. Execution available at: `12645`.

Record the target ledger for step 3.

```bash
TARGET_LEDGER=12645
```

## Step 3: Wait for Timelock (Optional Key Rotation)

Wait until the target ledger is reached. During this window, you can rotate keys for security:

### Key Rotation (Optional but Recommended)

1. **Generate new key:**

```bash
stellar keys generate new-admin-key
# Securely back up the secret key
```

2. **Export current admin from contract:**

```bash
CURRENT_ADMIN=$(stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --network testnet \
  --source $ADMIN_KEY \
  -- get_admin)
```

3. **Update admin in new code** (if contract includes admin management):

Edit contract code to hardcode new admin, or use a contract upgrade that changes admin permissions.

4. **Fund new key** (testnet):

```bash
stellar account create new-admin-key --starting-balance 10 --network testnet
```

## Step 4: Execute Upgrade

Check current ledger:

```bash
CURRENT_LEDGER=$(stellar ledger info --network testnet | grep "^Sequence" | awk '{print $2}')
echo "Current ledger: $CURRENT_LEDGER, Target: $TARGET_LEDGER"
```

If `CURRENT_LEDGER >= TARGET_LEDGER`, execute:

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --network testnet \
  --source $ADMIN_KEY \
  -- execute_upgrade
```

**Response:** Upgrade executed. New WASM deployed.

## Step 5: Verify New Code

Verify the upgrade:

```bash
# 1. Check new WASM hash matches:
stellar contract info \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --network testnet | grep "WASM Hash"

# Should match $WASM_HASH from step 1

# 2. Call a query function to confirm contract is live:
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --network testnet \
  --source $ADMIN_KEY \
  -- get_version

# Should return new version string
```

## Step 6: Resume Operations

Resume normal contract operations:

```bash
# Unpause (if contract was paused during upgrade)
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --network testnet \
  --source $ADMIN_KEY \
  -- unpause
```

## Rollback Procedure

If the upgrade fails:

### 1. Immediate Actions (Before Timelock Expires)

Cancel the proposal (if supported):

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --network testnet \
  --source $ADMIN_KEY \
  -- cancel_upgrade  # If this function exists
```

### 2. Restore Previous WASM

Redeploy the previous WASM:

```bash
# 1. Install old WASM
PREV_HASH=$(stellar contract install \
  --network testnet \
  --source $ADMIN_KEY \
  path/to/previous/wasm)

# 2. Create new upgrade proposal
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --network testnet \
  --source $ADMIN_KEY \
  -- propose_upgrade --wasm_hash $PREV_HASH

# 3. Wait and execute as in steps 3-4
```

### 3. Key Rotation for Revoked Keys

If keys were compromised:

```bash
# 1. Rotate to emergency key (pre-positioned)
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --network testnet \
  --source $EMERGENCY_KEY \
  -- rotate_admin --new_admin $EMERGENCY_KEY

# 2. Disable all other keys in your key management system
```

## Testing Upgrades (Local)

Test locally before mainnet deployment:

```bash
# 1. Deploy contract to local node
docker compose up stellar-node
stellar contract deploy \
  --network local \
  --source local-admin \
  target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_escrow_contract.wasm

# 2. Propose upgrade
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --network local \
  --source local-admin \
  -- propose_upgrade --wasm_hash $WASM_HASH

# 3. Mine blocks until timelock passed (locally, instant)
stellar ledger bump --network local

# 4. Execute and verify
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --network local \
  --source local-admin \
  -- execute_upgrade

# 5. Confirm new code
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --network local \
  -- get_version
```

## Safety Checklist

Before executing any upgrade:

- [ ] New WASM built and tested locally
- [ ] WASM hash verified matches `stellar contract install` output
- [ ] All state migrations planned (if storage format changed)
- [ ] Timelock delay respected (no shortcuts)
- [ ] Emergency key prepared and funded
- [ ] Rollback procedure tested locally
- [ ] Team notified of upgrade window
- [ ] Monitoring and alerts configured for post-upgrade
- [ ] Backup of previous WASM and state taken
- [ ] Admin key access reviewed and restricted

## Common Issues

### "Timelock not reached"
```
Error: Proposal not yet executable
Solution: Current ledger < target ledger. Wait for more blocks.
```

### "WASM hash mismatch"
```
Error: Installed WASM hash does not match proposal
Solution: Re-run stellar contract install with exact same binary
```

### "Admin not authorized"
```
Error: Caller not admin
Solution: Sign with correct admin key, check contract has correct admin set
```

## Mainnet Considerations

For mainnet deployments:

1. **Extend timelock delay:** Use `UPGRADE_DELAY_LEDGERS = 17_280` (1 day @ 5-second blocks)
2. **Governance approval:** Require multisig consensus before proposing
3. **Public announcement:** Notify users of upgrade schedule
4. **Parallel testing:** Deploy to testnet first, run for 24+ hours
5. **Monitoring:** Set up alerts for success/failure
6. **Post-upgrade audit:** Have third party verify new code
